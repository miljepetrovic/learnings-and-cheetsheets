# Rest API design Learnings & Cheatsheet

This repository represents my personal learning and cheatsheet repository with examples and learnings that I have found so far.

This project contains a controller with examples for covering the best practices for common REST API design use cases:

- API versioning ✅
- Resources names in plural (avoid verb usages and let HTTP method express intent) ✅ 
  - GET /tickets -> "Get tickets"
  - POST /tickets -> "Create a ticket"
- Status code usages with examples  ✅
- Validation of the incoming data/requests ✅
- Pagination ✅
- API Documentation ✅
- Authentication ❌

Look into TicketsController and let me know your thoughts.
